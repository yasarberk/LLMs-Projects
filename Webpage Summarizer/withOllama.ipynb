       "In the \"Gaming\" section, there's a lot about different games like Dead Stranding 2,Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown System Requirements Announced, Insomniac Games’ Next Game Will Be Marvel’s Venom!, and Anomaly Agent Review. These seem to be news items or summaries of game updates.\n",

       "I need to condense this information into markdown without any markdown formatting but using headers for each main category: Tech, Gaming, Entertainment, News. Under each category, bullet points with the key subheadings and the relevant content from the website.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, the user's instructions mention that I should act as an AI assistant with a certain level of language, perhaps more conversational than just formal or technical.
